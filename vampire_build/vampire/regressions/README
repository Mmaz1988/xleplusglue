Directory containing scripts for regression testing of Vampire

There are two kinds of regressions:

1) Scripts that do some check and exit with non-zero status if something went  
   wrong

Directory: regressions/scripts

These scripts are in the "scripts" subdirectory. There is currently just one,
ensure_only_allowed_trace_tags.sh, which goes through the Vampire sources and
fails if there is a LOG directive (or a similar, like COND_LOG, LOG_UNIT,...)
that uses tag which is not declared in Debug/Log_TagDecls.cpp.


  
2) Problems on which Vampire should be run

Directory: regressions/problems

Here are problems on which both debug and release version of Vampire is run
to make sure they behave as expected.

On none of the problem files the Vampire may crash and the files themselves
may specify some more assertions on Vampire's output.

Each of the files should be testing some particular feature of Vampire, as
sometime it is easier to write such file than to create a unit test. Also, 
a good habit is that when a bug is discovered, a file that reproduces the bug
is added among the problems.

For details on the format of the problem files see regressions/run_problem.sh.
One can for example include the following lines in the problem file:

% params: -sa inst_gen -updr off -fde none
% res: unsat

These mean that Vampire will be run with parameters "-sa inst_gen -updr off -fde none"
and it must give result UNSATISFIABLE (i.e. output proof).
